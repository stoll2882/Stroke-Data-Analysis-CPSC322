They will allow doctors to be more accurate when warning adults of risk-of-stroke, as well as giving people a better chance of knowing if they are at risk or not. If this classification is successful, it will provide which physical, mental, and lifestyle choices can increase risk of stroke, and therefore make sure lifestyle changes can be made in advance... and hopefully help save lives."
